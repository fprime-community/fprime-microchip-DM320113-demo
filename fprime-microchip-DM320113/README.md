## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of NASA's F' (F Prime) framework with the STMElectronics Microchip DM320113 demo board. It leverages FreeRTOS for task scheduling and real-time capabilities. The project is set up to be built with the `xc32` compiler, ensuring compatibility with the targeted hardware.

## Features

- **F Prime Integration:** Utilize the robust F Prime framework for building flight software applications.
- **FreeRTOS Support:** Benefit from the real-time capabilities of FreeRTOS.
- **Cross Compilation:** Use the `xc32` compiler for building the project.
- **Toolchain and Platform Configuration:** Custom `Toolchain.cmake` and `Platform.cmake` for the DM320113 board and FreeRTOS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
